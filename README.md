### // Recommendations

**Igor Guilherme Custodio**  
*iOS Developer at AlayaCare | Building Innovative Apps | SwiftUI & TCA enthusiast*  
> Matheus is an exceptional developer, he knows all about Swift and iOS development. When we worked together, Matheus managed the biggest improvements on the app like full modularization of the app, app size reduction, and improvement of the build compile (reduced from 20+ minutes to only 4 minutes). In my opinion, Matheus is a MUST in any team. Besides all his deep knowledge of iOS, he helps the team when needed and always tries to apply the best industry patterns to the code.  

**Diego Gomes Basilio Fernandes**  
*iOS Developer at BTG Pactual*  
> We give Gois our ideas, and they provide us with business analytics, design, and coding services. They’re fast and high-quality software developers, which is very rare to find. Their interaction with us is straightforward and distinctive, and they have a good process. Also, Gois helps us understand everything business-wise, and we like that we don’t have to worry about the technical side. They transform our ideas into code and friendly UX for the users.  

**Adriano Rodrigues**  
*iOS Developer at BTG Pactual*  
> Gois has great knowledge of the entire Apple ecosystem, being a technical reference in the project in which it operates. He is a restless professional, who is not satisfied with just "making it work", but always seeks to apply the best programming practices such as reuse, high cohesion, and low coupling.  

**Caroline Soares Pandolfe**  
*Front-end developer | JavaScript | React | Next | TypeScript*  
> Matheus is an exceptional professional. Always patient and willing to help students. I had the immense pleasure of working with him; he taught me a lot.
